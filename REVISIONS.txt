This is a list of revisions since the SHOP2 1.0 release.

New in version 1.2:
 + A Graphical User Interface has been created; it is described
   briefly in Section 8 of the manual.

 + There is a new keyword argument to the SHOP2 planner.  The argument
   is :explanation and it causes operators in the plan returned by SHOP2 to
   contain a logical explanation showing how their preconditions were
   met.  It is also documented in the manual (Section 5.1).

 + There are several new hook routines that are available for use in
   SHOP2; see Section 5.4 of the manual for details.

 + The Java Interface for SHOP2 has been extensively revised.  See the
   documentation in ji4shop2/doc for more details.

 + There have been some very minor bug fixes and enhancements.

New in version 1.1:
 + A Java interface for SHOP2 has been created.  It is in the ji4shop2
   directory and is documented briefly in the user's manual.

 + There is a new keyword argument to the SHOP2 planner.  The argument
   is :plan-tree; it causes SHOP2 to return the entire task
   decomposition tree rather than just leaves of the tree (i.e., the
   plan).  It is also documented in the manual.

 + The SHOP2 1.1 release includes a new example domain from the
   International Planning Competitions in the IPC-2000 directory.  In
   addition, several domains from the IPC-2002 competition are being
   released as a seperate download at the same time as the SHOP2 1.1
   release.  The IPC-2002 competition domains are available at:
    http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/shop/download.html

 + There have been some assorted bug fixes.
